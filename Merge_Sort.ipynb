It works by recursively dividing the input list into smaller sublists, sorting them individually, and then merging the sorted sublists to obtain the final sorted list. The process continues until the entire list is sorted.\n","\n","### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the merge sort algorithm:\n","\n","### Divide: The input list is divided into two halves by finding the middle element.\n","\n","### Conquer: Recursively apply the merge sort algorithm to sort the left and right halves.\n","\n","### Merge: Merge the sorted left and right halves by comparing the elements from each sublist and placing them in the correct order.\n","\n","### The merge operation is the key step in merge sort. It involves comparing the elements of the two sorted sublists and merging them into a single sorted list. The process continues until all elements from both sublists are merged.\n","\n","### Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average and worst cases, where n is the number of elements in the list. It is known for its stability (i.e., the relative order of equal elements is preserved) and efficient performance on large datasets.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yPY8gFWf6c8k"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Use Cases**\n","\n","### In the field of Data Science and Machine Learning, merge sort is primarily used in situations where sorting is required as a preprocessing step or as part of other algorithms. Here are a few areas where merge sort finds its application:\n","\n","### Sorting and Ranking: Merge sort is used to sort datasets based on specific criteria or to rank items according to their relevance or importance. For example, sorting data based on a particular feature value or ranking search results by relevance.\n","\n","### Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms: Many algorithms in data science and machine learning follow the divide-and-conquer paradigm, where large problems are divided into smaller subproblems. Merge sort's efficient sorting capabilities make it an ideal choice for dividing and merging steps in such algorithms.\n","\n","### External Sorting: Merge sort is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets that cannot fit into memory entirely. It can efficiently sort data stored on disk by performing external sorting, which involves reading and writing data in chunks.\n","\n","### Parallel Processing: Merge sort can be parallelized easily, making it suitable for parallel computing environments. By dividing the input into multiple sublists, sorting them in parallel, and merging the results, merge sort can take advantage of multi-core or distributed systems to achieve faster sorting."],"metadata":{"id":"_LywRTdd6vYP"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"id":"OSNbWZpN10zg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1685991053959,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":355,"user":{"displayName":"Saurabh Bhardwaj","userId":"16519378442147256210"}},"outputId":"e8b30d2a-da4f-40aa-d1a8-491d20e69634"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n"]}],"source":["def merge(list1, list2):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        list1 (list): The first sorted list.\n","        list2 (list): The second sorted list.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        list: The merged sorted list.\n","\n","    \"\"\"\n","    combined = []\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Initialize an empty list to store the merged list.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    i = 0\n","    j = 0\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Initialize two pointers for the two lists.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Compare the elements of both lists and merge them into the combined list in the correct order.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        if list1[i] < list2[j]:\n","            combined.append(list1[i])\n","            i += 1\n","        else:\n","            combined.append(list2[j])\n","            j += 1\n","    \n","    while i < len(list1):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Append the remaining elements of the first list to the combined list.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        combined.append(list1[i])\n","        i += 1\n","    \n","    while j < len(list2):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Append the remaining elements of the second list to the combined list.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        combined.append(list2[j])\n","        j += 1\n","    \n","    return combined\n","\n","\n","def merge_sort(my_list):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Sort a list in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        my_list (list): The list to be sorted.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        list: The sorted list.\n","\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if len(my_list) == 1:\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Base case: If the list has only one element, it is already sorted, so return the list.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        return my_list\n","    \n","    mid_index = int(len(my_list) / 2)\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Find the index of the middle element.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    left = merge_sort(my_list[:mid_index])\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Recursively sort the left half of the list.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    right = merge_sort(my_list[mid_index:])\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Recursively sort the right half of the list.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    return merge(left, right) #Merge the sorted left and right halves of the list.\n","\n","\n","print(merge_sort([4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3]))\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Test Cases**"],"metadata":{"id":"dsQoEXLl64P3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Test Case 1\n","input_list = [4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3]\n","expected_output = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","output = merge_sort(input_list)\n","print(output == expected_output)  # Expected output: True\n","\n","# Test Case 2\n","input_list = [9, 5, 7, 1, 3, 6]\n","expected_output = [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9]\n","output = merge_sort(input_list)\n","print(output == expected_output)  # Expected output: True\n","\n","# Test Case 3\n","input_list = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0]\n","expected_output = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n","output = merge_sort(input_list)\n","print(output == expected_output)  # Expected output: True\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"id":"gayqwk6022MU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1685991054171,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Saurabh Bhardwaj","userId":"16519378442147256210"}},"outputId":"5e3a4367-911f-4e33-c409-803bc921fbee"},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["True\n","True\n","True\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"BaYOhjdd36gl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1685990732217,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Saurabh Bhardwaj","userId":"16519378442147256210"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]}]}
