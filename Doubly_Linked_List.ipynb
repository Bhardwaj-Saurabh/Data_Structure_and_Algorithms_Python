This means that each node has two pointers: one to the previous node and one to the next node in the list.\n","\n","### Doubly linked lists have several advantages over singly linked lists. One of the main advantages is that it is easier to traverse the list both forwards and backwards. This is because each node has a reference to both the next and the previous node in the list. Additionally, it is easier to insert and delete nodes in a doubly linked list, since you can easily update the references to the previous and next nodes.\n","\n","## **Use cases in data science and real world**\n","### In data science, doubly linked lists can be used in a variety of ways. For example, they can be used to implement data structures such as priority queues, stacks, and queues. They can also be used in algorithms such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal.\n","\n","In the real world, doubly linked lists are commonly used in operating systems to maintain lists of active processes, in database systems to maintain indexes and in web browsers to maintain a history of visited pages. They are also used in many other applications where efficient data access and manipulation is required.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tNy4r8A6DOH7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Create Node Class**"],"metadata":{"id":"l1Hr_yy1C0L7"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Node:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A class representing a node in a doubly linked list.\n","\n","    Attributes:\n","    -
