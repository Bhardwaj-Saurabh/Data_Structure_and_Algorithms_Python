It efficiently sorts a list by recursively dividing it into smaller sublists, sorting them, and then combining them back together. The algorithm works as follows:\n","\n","### Choose a pivot element from the list. The pivot can be selected in different ways, such as the first element, last element, or a random element.\n","\n","### Partition the list into two sublists: one with elements smaller than the pivot and another with elements greater than the pivot. This step places the pivot in its correct position in the final sorted list.\n","\n","### Recursively apply the above two steps to the two sublists until the entire list is sorted.\n","\n","### The key idea behind Quick Sort is the efficient partitioning step. By choosing an appropriate pivot and placing it in its correct position, the algorithm can efficiently sort large lists in-place without requiring additional memory."],"metadata":{"id":"s_pojOuowzSj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Â **Use Cases in DL and ML:**\n","### Quick Sort itself is not directly used in Deep Learning (DL) or Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. However, sorting algorithms like Quick Sort have practical applications within DL and ML:\n","\n","### Feature Selection: In ML, feature selection is a crucial step to identify relevant features for model training. Sorting algorithms can be used to rank features based on their importance, enabling the selection of top-k features for better model performance.\n","\n","### K-nearest neighbors (KNN): KNN is a simple yet powerful ML algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority vote of their nearest neighbors. Quick Sort can be used to efficiently find the k nearest neighbors by sorting the data points based on their distances from a given query point.\n","\n","### Decision Trees: Decision Trees are widely used in ML for classification and regression tasks. Quick Sort can be used in building decision trees to efficiently split the data based on feature values. The pivot selection and partitioning steps resemble the process of finding optimal splits in decision tree algorithms.\n","\n","### Model Evaluation: Sorting algorithms can be utilized in ML model evaluation tasks, such as ranking predictions or evaluating model performance based on certain metrics. For instance, sorting predictions based on confidence scores can help identify top-performing predictions or outliers.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"W0Jb53VvxAoC"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"metadata":{"id":"uF6k1vn_oy6Z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686072270507,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":296,"user":{"displayName":"Saurabh Bhardwaj","userId":"16519378442147256210"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def swap(my_list, index1, index2):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Swap two elements in a list given their indices.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        my_list (list): The list in which the elements are swapped.\n","        index1 (int): The index of the first element.\n","        index2 (int): The index of the second element.\n","\n","    \"\"\"\n","    temp = my_list[index1]\n","    my_list[index1] = my_list[index2]\n","    my_list[index2] = temp\n","\n","\n","def pivot(my_list, pivot_index, end_index):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Move the pivot element to its correct position in the list and partition the list into two sublists.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        my_list (list): The list to be partitioned.\n","        pivot_index (int): The index of the pivot element.\n","        end_index (int): The index of the last element in the sublist.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        int: The final index of the pivot element after partitioning.\n","\n","    \"\"\"\n","    swap_index = pivot_index\n","\n","    for i in range(pivot_index + 1, end_index + 1):\n","        if my_list[i] < my_list[pivot_index]:\n","            swap_index += 1\n","            swap(my_list, swap_index, i)\n","    swap(my_list, pivot_index, swap_index)\n","    return swap_index\n","\n","\n","def quick_sort_helper(my_list, left, right):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Recursively sort a list in ascending order using the Quick Sort algorithm.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        my_list (list): The list to be sorted.\n","        left (int): The index of the leftmost element in the sublist.\n","        right (int): The index of the rightmost element in the sublist.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        list: The sorted list.\n","\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if left < right:\n","        pivot_index = pivot(my_list, left, right)\n","        quick_sort_helper(my_list, left, pivot_index - 1)\n","        quick_sort_helper(my_list, pivot_index + 1, right)\n","    return my_list\n","\n","\n","def quick_sort(my_list):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Sort a list in ascending order using the Quick Sort algorithm.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        my_list (list): The list to be sorted.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        list: The sorted list.\n","\n","    \"\"\"\n","    return quick_sort_helper(my_list, 0, len(my_list) - 1)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Test Cases**"],"metadata":{"id":"8Agfm-YRxOQQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Test Case 1: Sorting an unsorted list\n","my_list = [4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3]\n","sorted_list = quick_sort(my_list)\n","print(sorted_list)\n","# Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","\n","# Test Case 2: Sorting an empty list\n","my_list = []\n","sorted_list = quick_sort(my_list)\n","print(sorted_list)\n","# Expected output: []\n","\n","# Test Case 3: Sorting a list with duplicate elements\n","my_list = [4, 2, 6, 5, 2, 1, 3, 6, 4]\n","sorted_list = quick_sort(my_list)\n","print(sorted_list)\n","# Expected output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\n","\n","# Test Case 4: Sorting a list with negative numbers\n","my_list = [4, -2, 6, 5, -1, 3]\n","sorted_list = quick_sort(my_list)\n","print(sorted_list)\n","# Expected output: [-2, -1, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","\n","# Test Case 5: Sorting a list with already sorted elements\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","sorted_list = quick_sort(my_list)\n","print(sorted_list)\n","# Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"id":"C3C4iVrBtq3k","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686072271115,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Saurabh Bhardwaj","userId":"16519378442147256210"}},"outputId":"66972b5b-a58c-43b1-f94f-af8cd9d135f6"},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","[]\n","[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\n","[-2, -1, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Conclusion**\n","\n","### In summary, while Quick Sort itself may not be directly used in DL and ML algorithms, sorting algorithms play important roles in various tasks within these fields, such as feature selection, KNN, decision trees, and model evaluation.
