It is made up of a sequence of nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The first node is known as the head, and the last node is known as the tail. A linked list can be either singly linked or doubly linked, depending on whether each node contains a reference to both the next and previous nodes or only to the next node.\n","\n","## Use condition\n","Linked lists are useful in situations where dynamic data structures are needed. They are particularly useful when the number of elements in the data structure is unknown or when elements need to be inserted or deleted frequently. Some examples of real-world applications of linked lists are:\n","\n","**Browser history:** When you browse the internet, your browser keeps track of the websites you have visited in a linked list. Each website is stored as a node, and the user can traverse through the list using the forward and backward buttons.\n","\n","**Music player:** In a music player, the list of songs can be stored in a linked list. The user can move to the next or previous song by traversing through the list.\n","\n","**File system:** The file system in a computer uses a linked list to keep track of the location of files on the hard disk. Each file is represented as a node, and the location of the file is stored in the node.\n","\n","\n","Linked lists are useful in situations where the size of the data structure is unknown or changing, and where there is a need to frequently insert or delete elements from the structure. However, they are less efficient than arrays for accessing elements in a random order, and they require more memory because of the overhead of storing references to the next node."],"metadata":{"id":"8a_DQZzbuVMl"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"aJk8gTtHuedT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Create a Node Class"],"metadata":{"id":"4e6ac5NLuam0"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define a class called Node that represents a single node in the linked list.\n","# Each node has a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.\n","class Node:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A class representing a node in a singly linked list.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    def __init__(self, value = None):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Initialize a new node with a given value.\n","\n","        Args:\n","        -
