One such powerful data structure is the Binary Search Tree (BST). In this blog post, we will explore the fundamentals of Binary Search Trees and delve into their real-world applications across various industries. So, let's dive in and unlock the potential of BSTs!\n","\n","### Understanding Binary Search Trees:\n","### Binary Search Trees are hierarchical data structures that store and organize data in a sorted manner. Each node in a BST contains a value and has two child nodes - a left child and a right child. The left child contains a value smaller than the parent, while the right child contains a value greater than the parent. This unique property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations."],"metadata":{"id":"qybmu-JYgiLr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Real World Application\n","\n","### Real-World Applications of Binary Search Trees:\n","\n","### **a. Data Indexing and Searching:**\n","\n","### BSTs excel in scenarios where efficient searching is crucial. For example, in large databases or search engines, BSTs can be used to index and search for specific records based on certain criteria. This enables speedy retrieval of data, optimizing search operations and improving overall performance.\n","\n","### **b. Auto-Completion and Predictive Text:**\n","\n","### Ever wondered how your smartphone's keyboard suggests words as you type? BSTs are utilized behind the scenes to power auto-completion and predictive text features. By leveraging the sorted nature of BSTs, the system quickly identifies and suggests the most likely words or phrases, enhancing the user experience.\n","\n","### **c. File System Organization:**\n","\n","### BSTs find applications in organizing file systems efficiently. For instance, consider a file directory where files are stored in a hierarchical manner. By implementing a BST, file searches can be performed in logarithmic time complexity, simplifying file retrieval and management processes.\n","\n","### **d. Network Routing Algorithms:**\n","\n","### BSTs are fundamental to network routing algorithms used in telecommunications and computer networks. Routing tables in routers often employ BSTs to efficiently route data packets based on destination addresses. This enables faster and more accurate routing, reducing network congestion and optimizing data transmission.\n","\n","### **e. Database Query Optimization:**\n","\n","### BSTs are crucial in optimizing database query operations. Query optimization techniques leverage BSTs to efficiently filter and retrieve data based on specified conditions. This accelerates the execution of complex queries, improving the overall performance of database systems."],"metadata":{"id":"8-euaddbia6V"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Node:\n","    def __init__(self, value):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Node class represents a node in the Binary Search Tree.\n","\n","        Args:\n","            value: The value to be stored in the node.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        self.value = value  #
