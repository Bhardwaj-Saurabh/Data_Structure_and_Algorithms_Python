Each node can have attributes and properties associated with it.\n","\n","### **Edges:** Represent relationships or connections between nodes.

relationship."],"metadata":{"id":"Fb2yi1f23mJL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Types of Graphs:**\n","\n","### **Undirected Graphs:** Edges have no specific direction, and the relationships

weights that denote the strength, distance, or similarity between nodes.\n","\n","### **Bipartite Graphs:** Nodes can be divided into two distinct sets, with edges only connecting nodes from different sets.\n","\n","### **Multigraphs:** Multiple edges can exist between the same pair of nodes, each representing a different
